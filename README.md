# ABS-NaturalSorter-US
A userscript to naturally sort your Audiobookshelf Library.


# Introduction

Tired of looking at your Audiobookshelf Library and seeing how numbers are just not sorted right? Feeling that little itch, unable to be scratched?

Well, say no more!

With this userscript, utilizing Tampermonkey (Violentmonkey or Greasemonkey may work too, but haven't been tested), you'll be able to enjoy your Audiobooks or Audiodramas to be sorted just the way you like it, naturally.


# Installation

Simply install Tampermonkey from [their website](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

after that is done, click on [this link](https://github.com/holyarahippo06/ABS-NaturalSorter-US/blob/main/ABS-NaturalSorter.user.js?raw=true) to install the userscript.

Then, click on the Tampermonkey browser extension and click on Dashboard, then click on "ABS-NaturalSorter" and pretty close at the top, replace "INSERT_YOUR_AUDIOBOOKSHELF_LIBRARY_TITLE_SORT_LINK_HERE" with your Audiobookshelf URL from the Library View and with the title sorting.

Lastly, click on "File", then "Save" and you're Done.

Congratulations! Your Audiobookshelf is now sorted naturally!!!


May this bring peace upon your mind

## Now, just edit the Line 7, saying "INSERT_YOUR_AUDIOBOOKSHELF_LIBRARY_TITLE_SORT_LINK_HERE", by replacing it with the link you've just copied.

## (Optional) If you have multiple Libraries and want all of them to be sorted naturally, replace the string of numbers after "/library/" with a "*" like this:

## Lastly, just click on "File", then "Save" and you're done.

Though, for those that enjoy using the "Series" Tab instead, I'm sorry, as that doesn't work. I'm unsure if I'll do it in an update or not, but for now, I am done with this. Hope it still helps some of you out
